 *  Created by Boris Shabash, Ghassan Hamarneh,  Zhi Feng Huang , and Luis Ibanez on27/04/10.
 *  Copyright 2010 __MyCompanyName__. All rights reserved.
 *	
 *	This file was produced using the template itkYAFFImageIO. All I did here was replace 
 *	the name YAFFImageIO with itkiOSImageIO and change the arguments of the functions.
 *	The majority of the code is still written by ITK developers. This is designed only as
 *	a skeleton code for the final product
 *	
 *	Note that in the build process this file is not actually compiled (since it isn't
 *	included anywhere). It doesn't implement several virtual methods so including it
 *	introduces errors.
